# AI-Process-Spectrum

This is a reflective tool for students and educators to explore the spectrum of AI-assisted writing and reading in educational contexts.

This interactive visualization helps users locate their AI-assisted practices in educational contexts along a gradient â€” from no AI use, to appropriate support, to overreliance and potential misconduct. Designed as a pedagogical aid, the tool foregrounds agency, authorship, integrity, and reflective thinking as we navigate emerging relationships with generative technologies in learning environments.
